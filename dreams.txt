 ほっと  with a feeling of relief; with a sigh of relief
 なんか something like ...;
 無視 ignoring
 鉢植え potted plant
 彫刻 engraving
 溶ける melt
 中毒 poisoning
 不足 insufficient  



A native speaker proofread this? Uhh… idk about that. You sure that was a native speaker? Sounding weird in order to simplify a sentence is one thing, but the issues I saw from the three stories I picked at random make the sentences mean something else, or on the verge of what I’d consider ungrammatical.

    ロンドン の 地下鉄では ヘッドホン で 音楽を 聞く →Using では would make it sound like that’s the rule/norm, not describing what is going on. Unless using headphones is in fact the norm and it’s weird not to?

    「虎の目がある」 どの歌手が歌う？ →If this is referring to the Eye of the Tiger, you should be careful about translating proper nouns. If it’s referring to Roar, well, same idea. Always look up proper nouns.

    コンサートに走ろう！ →This gives me the vibes of google translate 10 year ago.
