MArkus made the rune network possible. 

Chapter 2 Markus visits Rich and offers to come but Rich can't.
Markus Sofia and Batz walk to the first mine.
On the way they talk/show how batz is storng now.
Once in the mine Markus talk about the construction of Akotis and the espers.
At the end they find a few gems that Markus takes. They will be used for photos.
During the competition these stones will be used.
They swear to maek the world change the 3 of them.

Knights of Akotis catch robbers.

They have to search for a mine tto find more gems and tbey find one in the mountain.
That's where the two knights of the council disappear and Jinedine story starts.

In th councile
2 knights
one woman (researcher teacher) who is pro markus.
1 old man who is philosophical
1 very into ethics.
One into politics but betting on the wrong horse.

and decides to spy Maybe he claims the stuff needs maintenance / upgrade

Chapter 5 / 6 > Markus takes power (rich is kicked away in part 3)



### Bear in mind

In what order are technologies developped ?
Espers must have a place
Nikolo hires Batz' friends
What about Sofia ? 
The world is changing | connected | make world better place
Explain a bit how Akotis was born ? Maybe he talks about it in the mine.
Maybe in the mine they don't find anything, they only reflect ? and make a pact ?
They think about how the city was created how rune were discovered and how things are changing 


Markus does not want to share knowledge so expelled from uni. It has to be highlighted
####



Chapter 3 
Try to play it the right way but half the professors do not agree
but it does not work 
so start placing spyuing device That he cratsf secretly

Chapter 4 
Catches private info 
Maybe gets to travel out of town.
Where they found some rune stones in the mountain
And he meets worm again 

MAke them meet someone like a woman selling flowers


Chapter 5 

Chapter 6 takes power


then they try to increase trade and get scolded. That's when he starts spying to get the eldest to give him power.

In part 3 make the tower grow higher

Trees behind are to remember the dead peops

Markus ascent > he ends at the top floor of the university in part 2 


Markus has developped a way to create groups and Nikolo has sold rune stones in a town not too far that allow that and people love them.
He does not want to share how to do it. He becomes rich because of that. University wants knowledge to be shared. He has then to take the power of the university.


CElestina thinks someone needs to stop him and hears a voice : I will. IT's worm.

Don't forget that people have to sell runes to the sailor.
