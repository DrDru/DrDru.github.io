Markus ascent > he ends at the top floor of the university in part 2 


Markus has developped a way to create groups and Nikolo has sold rune stones in a town not too far that allow that and people love them.
He does not want to share how to do it. He becomes rich because of that. University wants knowledge to be shared. He has then to take the power of the university.


CElestina thinks someone needs to stop him and hears a voice : I will. IT's worm.

Don't forget that people have to sell runes to the sailor.
